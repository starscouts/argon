  "lyrics": "As I stare out from the edge\nWhere the laughter was now echoes silence\nAs I reach out to the dark\nWhere the brightest rainbow now falls black\n\nI scream out loud, to where you are\nThough I know my voice can't reach that far\nI'll light a spark, bright memories\nAnd cast a spell to bring you back to me\n\nWe are candles in the rain\nBurning bright 'til we're snuffed out\nSo many lights along the way\nI've seen them flash just as they-\n\nI'm gonna grab that light\nThese thoughts won't take me over again\nGonna make it right\nThis won't be the road I walk\nI'll step back from the edge\nTake me home again\n'Cause I'm gonna grab that light\nI wanna see that better tomorrow\n\nWe are candles in the rain\nBurning bright 'til we're snuffed out\nSo many lights along the way\nI've seen them flash just as they drowned\n\nI won't let you fade in the dark\nIt's hard remembering your voice\nI've gotta see those smiles again\nThough it's selfish do I have a choice\n\nWe are candles in the rain\nBurning bright 'til we're snuffed out\nSo many lights along the way\nI've seen them flash just as they-\n\nI'm gonna grab that light\nThese thoughts won't take me over again\nGonna make it right\nThis won't be the road I walk\nI'll step back from the edge\nTake me home again\n'Cause I'm gonna grab that light\nI wanna see that better tomorrow\n\n<i>We are candles in the rain</i>\n<i>Burning bright 'til we're snuffed out</i>\n<i>So many lights along the way</i>\n<i>I've seen them flash just as they drowned</i>\n\n<i>We are candles in the rain</i>\n<i>Burning bright 'til we're snuffed out</i>\n<i>So many lights along the way</i>\n<i>I've seen them flash just as they drowned</i>\n\n<i>We are candles in the rain</i>\n<i>Burning bright 'til we're snuffed out</i>\n<i>So many lights along the way</i>\n<i>I've seen them flash just as they drowned</i>\n\n<i>We are candles in the rain</i>\n<i>Burning bright 'til we're snuffed out</i>\n<i>So many lights along the way</i>\n<i>I've seen them flash just as they-</i>\n\nI'm gonna grab that light\nThese thoughts won't take me over again\nGonna make it right\nThis won't be the road I walk\nI'll step back from the edge\nTake me home again\n'Cause I'm gonna grab that light\nI wanna see that better tomorrow",
