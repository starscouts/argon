  "lyrics": "You look at me like you think\nI'll never earn my mark\nWell I'll prove you wrong just you watch\nI'll leave you all in the dark\n\nSo many years I've waited\nUnder the likes of you\nWho would make fun point and laugh\nAnd call me blank flank too\n\nWell listen now\nMy name is Scootaloo\n\nI'll soar into that sky\nOn these wings small and pure\nOh how I dream to fly\nMy heart is aching for\nA chance to show them all\nJust how much I could be\nThey call me chicken but\nSoon I'll make you all see\n\nMy friends are right there for me\nJust like we'd always planned\nBut they'rе not pegasi like me\nSo thеy can't understand\nThe pain of being stuck here\nUnder the sky so blue\nThese feathered wings aren't meant for this\nWill I ever make it through\n\nWell listen now\nMy name is Scootaloo\n\nI'll soar into that sky\nOn these wings small and pure\nOh how I dream to fly\nMy heart is aching for\nA chance to show them all\nJust how much I could be\nThey call me chicken but\nSoon I'll make you all see\n\nI'll make you see\n\nI swear it now swear, to the open sky\nSomeday I'll show you all\nThis filly will learn to fly\nI swear it now swear, it to myself\nI'll make something of me\nAnd I don't want your help\n\nNow is my only chance\nI'll show them I can fly\nI'll prove you wrong or die\n\nNow is my only chance\nNo matter what the risks are\nCan't turn back I've come this far\n\nI'll soar into that sky (I swear it now)\nOn these wings small and pure (Swear to the open sky)\nOh how I dream to fly (Someday I'll show you all)\nMy heart is aching for (This filly will learn to fly)\nA chance to show them all (I swear it now)\nJust how much I could be (Swear it to myself)\nThey call me chicken but (I'll make something of me)\nSoon I'll make you all see (And I don't want your help)",
